#### Integrating genomics in species distribution modelling
<br>
This directory contains scripts for genomic analyses as part of species distribution modelling.<br>
The idea here is to develop ancestry probability maps or calculate genetic distances which will be used to generate a raster layer that will inform the species distribution model.<br>
<br>
**NB: This directory is named "bash" since the data used are stored in the Phoenix HPC (University of Adelaide) and will be processed using the bash command line before a usable VCF is post-processed in R.**
