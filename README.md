## Tracking Species Trajectories funded by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW)

This repository contains input data and code used for developing species distribution models for the project of <i><b>Tracking species trajectories</i></b> funded by the DCCEEW. 

This project aims to update species distribution models for two Critically Endangered sea snake species (EPCB Act 1999): the Short-nosed sea snake (<i>Aipysurus apraefrontalis</i>) and the Leaf-scaled sea snake (<i>A. foliosquama</i>). In this project, we aim to incorporate species ancestry coefficient values (i.e., genetic information) in generating said updated species distribution models. Doing so may progress our understanding of current species-specific distributions as well as inform potential key locations for future surveys.
