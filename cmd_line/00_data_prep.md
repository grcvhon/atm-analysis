### Determine samples of <i>Aipysurus apraefrontalis</i> and <i>A. foliosquama</i> with RADseq data

This step involves collating information regarding samples of <i>Aipysurus apraefrontalis</i> and <i>A. foliosquama</i> that have available RADseq data (i.e., available in Phoenix HPC:/uofaresstor/sanders_lab/). 
The goal of this collation is to generate a sample sheet that has at least the following information: `DaRTseq order number`,`DaRT ID`,`ID clean` (for an example, see https://github.com/a-lud/sea-snake-dart/blob/main/data/sample-sheets/240524-sample-linkage.csv).
This format is improves efficiency when using workflow in genomics analyses.<br>

<i>NB: Scripts were not used entirely to collate information and some manual manipulation is required (e.g., via MS Excel).</i><br>

#### 1) Extract information from DaRTseq master spreadsheet
First, we refer to the file: `DARTseq_master.xlsx` (version as of 11 February 2025)
